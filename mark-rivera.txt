Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        An inline element does not take up the entire width of a page on one line, while a block element will always do so regardless of the content.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely?
        An element is taken out of the normal flow of the page and positioned dependant on its nearest positioned element.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width?
        YOu could use min-width property. 

        min-width: 200px;

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        block elements:
            div, section, p

        inline:
            span, img
        
        inline-block:
            button

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
        The box model is the idea that every element will be represented by a 'box' in the browser. The boxes will have different sizes, shapes, paddings, margins etc depending on the css.
        A box can be broken up into a few parts. Margin, Border, Padding and Content.

        When setting the width and height of the box content, the box model unfortunately does not account for padding and margin. So you must manually add or remind yourself during calculations. However there is a fix if you just apply: 
        
            box-sizing: border-box
